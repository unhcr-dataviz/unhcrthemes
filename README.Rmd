Simplify the creation of your data visualizations with the `{unhcrthemes}` R package. It is designed to align your plots with [UNHCR's data visualization](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/guidance/) recommendations. This package offers a comprehensive `{ggplot2}` theme, including built-in customizations and thoughtfully crafted color palettes.

## Features

- A consistent and appealing `{ggplot2}` theme that matches [UNHCR Data Visualization Guidelines](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/guidance/).
- A collection of color palettes ensuring your plots are consistent with [UNHCR's color scheme](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/guidance/).
- Easy-to-use functions to apply the theme and color palettes to your `{ggplot2}` plots.

## Installation

Get started by installing the `{unhcrthemes}` package from CRAN with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("unhcrthemes")
```

Or retrieve the development version from Github using the `{pak}` package:

```{r pak, eval=FALSE}
# If pak is not yet installed, uncomment the following line:
# install.packages("pak")

pak::pkg_install("unhcr-dataviz/unhcrthemes")
```

## Usage

```{r load, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)
library(unhcrthemes)
```

### Base `{ggplot2}` theme

```{r base-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
# Apply the theme_unhcr() to your plot
ggplot(
  mtcars,
  aes(x = hp, y = mpg)
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Simple scatterplot with ggplot",
    subtitle = "This plot shows the default style of theme_unhcr()",
    x = "Horsepower (hp)",
    y = "Fuel efficiency (mpg)",
    caption = "Source: mtcars"
  ) +
  theme_unhcr()
```

### Fonts

One of the two officially recommended fonts outlined in the [UNHCR Data Visualization Guidelines](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/guidance/) is [`Lato`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato). To ensure optimal functionality of the `{unhcrthemes}` package, please make sure that the `Lato` font is installed on your device prior to usage.
 
For `R` PDF (`pdf`) and PostScript (`postcript`) devices, there is a function `import_lato` that can be used to import the `Lato` font into these two devices. We recommend the use of `cairo_pdf` or `cairo_ps` devices, which work when you have `Lato` installed. They are available on all platforms and have better support custom fonts.

### Color palettes

Choose from a variety of carefully curated color palettes that harmonize with UNHCR's visual identity.

```{r palette-all, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.height=6}
# Display all unhcr color palette
display_unhcr_all()
```

```{r palette-blue, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.height=2}
# Or select a specific one and limit the number of colors
display_unhcr_pal(n = 3, "pal_blue")
```

### Scales (color/fill)

```{r scale-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
# Add color scale to your plot
ggplot(
  mtcars,
  aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = as.factor(cyl))
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .8) +
  labs(
    title = "Simple scatterplot with ggplot",
    subtitle = "This plot shows the default style of theme_unhcr()",
    x = "Horsepower (hp)",
    y = "Fuel efficiency (mpg)",
    color = "Number of cylinder",
    caption = "Source: mtcars"
  ) +
  scale_color_unhcr_d() +
  theme_unhcr(legend_title = TRUE)
```

### Geoms (text/label)

```{r geom-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.height=4}
# Default Lato font also apply for geom_text and label
dplyr::count(mpg, class) |>
  dplyr::arrange(n) |>
  dplyr::mutate(class = factor(class, levels = class)) |>
  ggplot(aes(n, class)) +
  geom_col(fill = unhcr_pal(n = 1, "pal_blue")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Simple bar chart with labels using ggplot",
    subtitle = "This plot shows the default style of theme_unhcr()",
    caption = "Source: mtcars"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(c(0, 0.1))) +
  theme_unhcr(grid = FALSE, axis = "y", axis_title = FALSE, axis_text = "y")
```
