# Template

::: {.lead .unhcr-grey}
This R Markdown document includes all the necessary features and styles to create an UNHCR branded report.
:::

This specific template is using principally the Pagedown package, for all the information about the package see <https://pagedown.rbind.io/>. The template targets mainly the creation of paginated HTML reports that can be easily printed as PDF, but from one R Markdown document we can have many different outputs (see below).

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Preview paged HTML report

When you compile an R Markdown document to HTML in RStudio, RStudio will display the HTML page through a local web server, so paged.js will work in RStudio Viewer. However, when you view such pages in a real web browser, you will need a separate web server. The easiest way to preview these HTML pages in a web browser may be through the RStudio **servr** package, just type the following code in your R console and head to <http://127.0.0.1:4321/> in your browser to access the files.

```{r servr, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Load webserver to preview paged HTML 
servr::httd()
```

## Print to PDF

The easiest way to print to PDF is with Google Chrome or Chromium using the menu “Print” or by pressing Ctrl + P (or Command + P on macOS). Remember to allow background graphics to be printed.

There are also 2 other built-in ways:

1. using the function pagedown::chrome_print(). Its first argument (input) accepts a path to a local Rmd or HTML file or an URL. Google Chrome or Chromium must be installed on your system.
2. in RStudio, adding the following line in the YAML header of your Rmd file:

```{r print, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
knit: pagedown::chrome_print
```

With this metadata parameter, the behavior of the “Knit” button of RStudio is modified: it produces both the HTML document and the PDF with Chrome. This functionality is suitable for any R Markdown HTML output format and is mainly convenient for small documents like presentations or notes.
If chrome_print() cannot find Chrome or Chromium automatically, set the PAGEDOWN_CHROME environment variable to the path to Chrome or Chromium executable.

## YAML metadata

A lot of components such as the table of contents, list of figures, etc. can be activated, deactivated or tweaked directly in the YAML at the top of the R Markdown document. Please refer at the guidance directly added there.

See <https://pagedown.rbind.io/#miscellaneous-features> for extra information on the YAML variables of the package.

## Plots

You can also embed plots created directly in R. Please review the vignette on the `unhcr_theme` for `ggplot2` for more details on how to create chart following UNHCR brand.

If you have the List of figure activated you will need to include `fig.cap` in code chunk parameter. The text will be used for the caption itself as well as the name in the List of figure.


```{r single-line, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot caption example"}
ggplot(datasets::iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Petal length", y="Petal width",
      title = "Iris data ggplot2 scatterplot example",
      subtitle= "Just a simple plot to show the basic style of theme_unhcr",
      caption = "Data from datasets::iris") +
  theme_unhcr(base_size = 14)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot and only show the plot itself in the report.

## Tables

You can also embed tables. The easiest way is to use the `kable` function from the `knitr` package, that is included in the code chunks of your Rmd file. UNHCR styles are applied by default to the tables.

**Example:**

```{r table-simple, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(datasets::iris, 5),
             caption = "Table caption example")
```
