# unhcrthemes (development version)

## Breaking changes

- Removed the dependency on `{extrafont}`, as its dependency `{Rttf2pt1}` is scheduled for removal from CRAN.  
- The function `lato_registered()`, which verified if Lato was registered through `{extrafont}`, has been **removed**.  
- The function `import_lato()` now only imports Lato via `{systemfonts}`.  

## Notes

- This change does **not** affect the use of `{unhcrthemes}` in general workflows.  
- However, it limits the possibility to create PDFs with the official Lato font **embedded**. Users can still rely on system-installed fonts for consistent rendering. 

# unhcrthemes 0.7.0

## Updates aligned with 2025 UNHCR Data Visualization Guidelines

- Updated `theme_unhcr()` to reflect revised text and gridline colors based on the latest UNHCR standards.
- Revised existing color palettes for improved clarity, contrast, and alignment with new data visualization guidance.
- Added new categorical, sequential and diverging color palettes recommended in the 2025 guidelines.

*Note: Existing palettes remain available but may have slight adjustments. Deprecated colors will be phased out in a future release.*

For reference, see the [UNHCR Data Visualization Guidelines (2025)](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/guidance/) for more details.
